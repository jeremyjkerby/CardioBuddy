# Cardio Buddy

## Purpose
This application is intended for anyone of all ages and backgrounds who are looking for a way to keep track of their cardio workouts on general cardio equipment. Stationary Bike, Treadmill, Elliptical, and Stair Climber are currently supported. There is no need for any expensive or fancy sensors. Simply add data displayed from the cardio equipment at the end of every session.

## Overview
Normal users are able to interact with this software through the Android application. Currently, the server acts as a way for users to backup their informatiom if they desire.

### Server
The server is built with Python's Flask framework and uses a MySQL library. It provides a custom built API to communicate with multiple Android mobile devices. The server has simple authentication functionality using Auth0 JWT.

### Android
The Android application utilizes multi-window user interface, stores data locally on user devices using SQLite, and communicates with a headless server via a custom built API.
